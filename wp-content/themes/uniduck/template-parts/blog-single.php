		<p>Once upon a time in a kingdom far-far-away in the lands of the never-ending spring, a king sat in his golden throne and ruled his kingdom in perfect harmony. A person can feel nothing but exuberance at the sight of the magnificent castle in which the king and his daughter lived, the majestic atmosphere of the woods spread all around the castle, and last but not least — the overwhelming beauty of the princess.</p>
		<h1>Heaven-on-Earth</h1>
		<p>It was pure Heaven-on-Earth; there was nothing that could even possibly attain the perfection of this place. The beauty of the forest made it amazing, yet another thing made it imposing. In those woods lived creatures of time unknown and one of them was the most precious of them all... and was hunted for centuries for its magical horn — the beast known as a unicorn.</p>
		<p>One day a rumor started spreading. Someone saw a white creature with the looks of a horse, yet having a beautiful horn...<q class="qoute-r">"Someone saw a white creature with the looks of a horse, yet having a beautiful horn..."</q> and suddenly all men grabbed their knives and spears, their bloodlust and fierceness. The hunt had begun.</p>
		<p>While the king's men were all setting torches on fire and sharpening their tools, the young princess was at her chamber, brushing her beautiful silky blond hair. She was the purest maiden in the whole kingdom with a heart as tender as a rose and a soul as clean as the water from the Fountain of Youth in the woods. She had an adventurous spirit and that day she decided to take a walk in the surrounding forests. Pushed by the desire to pick some fresh flowers, she left the castle and headed towards the woods.</p>

		<h1>"Could it be tr..."</h1>
		<p>With all beauty of the trees and flowers and the crystal cleanness of the mineral springs she lost track of time and wandered around for hours and hours and suddenly, she was very deep into the woods.
		She started realizing that the woods were getting darker and darker and the trees were losing their beauty, the grass was dead and there were no animals around. She started getting scared and remembered a story heard long ago from her nanny, a story about the Dark Forest, deep inside the beautiful surrounding woods.
		Everyone believed it was just a legend, that it wasn't a real place,<q class="qoute-l">"Everyone believed it was just a legend, that it wasn't a real place..."</q> but right at that moment she was thinking it over. "Could it be tr..." she couldn't even finish her thought when tree branches started grabbing her legs and arms and taking her deeper and deeper into the forest...
		Everyone believed it was just a legend, that it wasn't a real place...</p>
		<h1>The White Beast</h1>
		<p><span>The creature</span> was stepping lightly onto the grass, slowly moving between the trees, heading towards the little glade where she was lying unconsciously. As approaching, it saw the purity of the girl in front of him and slowly began to trust that innocent maid.</p>
		<p>When the unicorn got to her, he bent his neck down and looked at her beautiful face and slowly lied down next to her. After a while she woke up and firstly got a little scared, yet after looking at its harmless black eyes, she felt safe. Then the white beast stood up and let her get on its back and they both headed towards the castle. The princess was charmed by that creature's innocence and nobility, by its graceful movements between the trees and its gentle steps on the grass — pure harmony.</p>

		<h1>The Purest Creature</h1>
		<p>When they reached the castle and went inside the stone walls all of a sudden, a lot of armed people surrounded them and the unicorn started neighing and moving abruptly. <span>The princess</span> got down on the ground and started screaming and telling the men that this creature saved her life and brought her back to the castle. When the king came, she explained him everything that happened and he, while crying, told her that everyone had gotten worried about her. He hugged his precious daughter and looked at the terrified beast. Not until then he did realize that the unicorn is the purest and the most innocent creatures of them all.</p>
		<h1>Scared Animal</h1>
		<p>During the feast that night, it was pronounced that the unicorn is a sacred animal and it was forbidden hunting it. After saving the young princess, the beast left the castle and never got back. No one ever saw it again, but now all men knew the truth about the unicorn. It is said that the king's daughter met the unicorn again, yet that is a different story....</p>
